### PR Needed:
1. Build more levels
2. Add an option for another player for multiplayer game
3. Music and soundeffects
4. Add scoring system
5. Create new mechanics to make the game more interesting (improvements to the player's sling shot, jumping, traps, side quests)

### Used to love this game as a kid!
